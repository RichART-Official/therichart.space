description: Bytecode is a young, driven digital agency that wants to make you as effective as possible at what you do. That's why they strive to solve the puzzle of reseaching and createating digital solutions that fit like a glove. They asked me to create and professionalise their visual language and to help implementing it on assets like their new website.
